# EdgerunnerBOT
Personal bot that integrates Twitch and Discord functions. Made it because #### subscriptions for advanced functions on other bots

Didn't add node-modules folder as it has more than 100 files, and also its not necessary

It uses discord.js, tmi.js, node-twitch, ws, fs and axios libraries.

It is code-locked to work for mine Twitch and Discord. So if you ever find a way to add it to your own server, it won't work for you. Might the coding Gods be with you.
